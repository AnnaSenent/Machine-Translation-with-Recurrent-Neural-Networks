# Machine-Translation-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

## Introduction

This is the second project in [Udacity](udacity.com)'s [Natural Language Processsing Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892).
Its goal is to build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. When completed the pipeline will take English text as input and return the French translation.

In this notebook, I will cover all the steps that are needed to complete this project.

### Setup

GPU acceleration is required in order for the project to run efficiently. I worked on Udacity workspaces, which provide GPU support by conveniently switching to GPU mode.

### Required libraries

- Numpy
- Keras
- Tensorflow
